The division algorithm for integers states that given any two integers a and b, with b > 0,
we can find integers q and r such that 0 < r < b and a = bq + r.

The numbers q and r should be thought of as the quotient and remainder that result when b is divided into a.
Of course the remainder r is non-negative and is always less that the divisor, b.
